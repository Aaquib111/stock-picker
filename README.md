# Stock Picker

## How do I plan on this working?
- Detect retail interest by scanning popular social media (Reddit, Seeking Alpha, etc) for interest spikes in certain stocks
- Detect sentiment through AI model to make sure people are truly interested in the stock
- Suggest these stocks to the user, and then the user can go ahead with the long/short volatility play

## TODO
- Get list of trending stocks through r/wallstreetbets
- Detect sentiment in the comments of r/wallstreetbets posts
- Print these trending stocks to the user
